## I'm Bruno Pedrosa

# Here's some info about me:
I love using codes to help me solve my day-by-day problems. 

I'm currently enrolled on a Computer Science BTech graduation and working my way to become a Software Developer. I'm also a FullStack Development Student at Trybe and an Alumni at Rocketseat's GoStack bootcamp (both of which you can find more info about on my linkedin) :computer:

Always enthusiastic and constantly learning and improving! :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I'm working on my brand new portfolio using React, TypeScript as well as some other libraries and you can check out my progress [Here](https://github.com/BrunoPDRS/portfolio-react). 
(Always open to sugestions :wink: )
